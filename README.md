I take pride in leading with empathy and precision‚Äîimplementing data-driven strategies, improving support processes, and building systems that scale with product growth.

With hands-on experience across diverse WordPress ecosystems, I specialize in plugin and theme debugging, performance optimization, and translating technical challenges into clear, actionable solutions for both users and internal teams.

In addition to product and platform expertise, I also bring strong knowledge of hosting environments, server configurations, and performance tuning.
